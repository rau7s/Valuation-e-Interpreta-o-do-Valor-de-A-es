probability 
good strategy = winrate 40-60%

capital management
risk management: RR >= 2 times

por mês, normalmente 8-20% 

high winrate = performance better
highr RR = bigger profit

tentar focar no máximo, estourando em até 7 ativos no total:
1 a 2 por dia é o ideal
4 a 7 por semana ok

risk trade 0.1 - 0.5% capital (day)
or 1 -2% week


manter consistente por 5 meses
pois no começo vai ser foda, dps vai mandar bem
dps vai ser foda dnv

Entry - tp - sl - risky zone

risk management = quick exit skill = small wins/losses
trailling stop skill = big winds

undestandting trading strategy -> read Market pictur -> entry/exit

new trader -> 3 months on backtest -> then become experience trader -> FW test -> consistency
